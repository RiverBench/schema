This directory contains sources for ontologies that may be used for describing RiverBench datasets. These files are loaded by the CI worker when generating documentation to obtain the relevant labels and descriptions for properties and classes.

Please refer to each ontology's source for licensing information. They are not licensed under the same license as RiverBench.

The ontologies were edited for brevity by removing unnecessary properties to speed up documentation generation.
